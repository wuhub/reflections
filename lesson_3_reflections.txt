When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

   Collaborate with others with the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   When you are doing feature development, you don't want other changes on the GitHut to interrupt with your
   development rather you will merge your feature with other comments on the master later on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

   Fork: links initial GitHub repo from another repo instead of copying over
   Clone: copies GitHub repo to the local 
   Branch: makes tag or copy from another branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

   It will help determine whether the local copy is out of sync with remote (GitHub).

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

   Without using Git or GitHub, you have to mail the changed file and diff manually to another designers.
   By using difference branch and pull request for the reviews, it will not impact on the master branch.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

   Separate branch: provide great flexablity to incorperate with developed feature with main branch.  But,
   it also creates complication.

   Master branch: easy to make changes but would impact with other developers who have separate branches.
